        <p>I stopped by Sephora one afternoon, planning just to browse, but a friendly associate approached and asked if I needed help. I casually mentioned I’d been struggling to find the right foundation shade, and she immediately offered to do a color match. She asked about my skin type and coverage preferences, then carefully selected a few shades to try. After testing under different lighting, we found the perfect match—lightweight but with great coverage. She even shared some tips on how to make it look flawless without feeling heavy.

As we wrapped up, I wandered over to the lipsticks, and she noticed I was eyeing a few shades. She offered to help me try some on, suggesting a soft berry color I wouldn’t have picked myself. It turned out to be perfect! By the time I checked out, I’d not only found a new foundation and lipstick, but she’d also thrown in a few samples she thought I’d like. What started as a casual visit turned into a mini-makeover, and I left feeling like I’d had a personalized experience..</p>
